Boilerplate code for Android Wear watchfaces

This library comes from a lot of the watchfaces I've designed. Many have had similar interfaces and code, and I have had to copy and paste across them all. I've also wanted to tie in a lot of debug options but do so in a way that extends to all my watchfaces.
